# TCFD Pillars Reference

Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures — 4-pillar framework.

> Note: TCFD was disbanded in October 2023. Monitoring transferred to IFRS Foundation.
> IFRS S1 & S2 (now ASRS in Australia) are substantially aligned with TCFD.
> TCFD remains widely used voluntarily and is referenced in many frameworks globally.

## The 4 Pillars

### 1. GOVERNANCE
*Disclose the organization's governance around climate-related risks and opportunities.*

| Recommended Disclosure | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| (a) Board oversight | Describe the board's oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities | Narrative |
| (b) Management's role | Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks | Narrative |

**Key questions to address:**
- Does a board committee oversee climate risk? Which one?
- How often is climate discussed at board level?
- What is the management structure for climate (e.g. Chief Sustainability Officer)?
- Are climate KPIs linked to executive remuneration?

### 2. STRATEGY
*Disclose the actual and potential impacts on the organization's businesses, strategy, and financial planning.*

| Recommended Disclosure | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| (a) Risks and opportunities | Describe climate-related risks and opportunities over short, medium, and long term | Narrative |
| (b) Impact on organisation | Describe the impact on business, strategy, and financial planning | Narrative + data |
| (c) Resilience of strategy | Describe the resilience of the strategy under different climate scenarios including 2°C or lower | Narrative |

**Climate Risk Categories:**
- **Physical risks — Acute:** Extreme weather events (floods, fires, storms)
- **Physical risks — Chronic:** Rising temperatures, sea level rise, changing precipitation
- **Transition risks — Policy & Legal:** Carbon pricing, emissions regulations, litigation
- **Transition risks — Technology:** Disruption from low-carbon technology shifts
- **Transition risks — Market:** Changing customer preferences, commodity price shifts
- **Transition risks — Reputational:** Perceptions around climate performance

**Time Horizons (define these for your organisation):**
- Short term: typically ≤1 year
- Medium term: typically 1–5 years
- Long term: typically 5+ years (ASRS extends to alignment with asset lives)

### 3. RISK MANAGEMENT
*Disclose how the organization identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks.*

| Recommended Disclosure | Description | Type |
|---|---|---|
| (a) Risk identification & assessment process | Describe processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks | Narrative |
| (b) Risk management process | Describe processes for managing climate-related risks | Narrative |
| (c) Integration into overall risk management | Describe how climate risk is integrated into overall risk management | Narrative |

**Key questions to address:**
- Is climate included in the enterprise risk register?
- Who owns climate risk management?
- What thresholds trigger escalation?
- How are physical vs transition risks assessed differently?

---

### 4. METRICS & TARGETS
*Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage climate-related risks and opportunities.*

| Recommended Disclosure | Description | Unit |
|---|---|---|
| (a) Metrics used to assess climate risk | Disclose metrics used to assess climate-related risks in line with strategy | Various |
| (b) Scope 1, 2, 3 emissions | Disclose Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, and if appropriate Scope 3 | tCO₂e |
| (c) Targets | Describe targets used to manage climate risks and performance against them | Various |

**Commonly reported TCFD metrics:**
| Metric | Unit |
|---|---|
| Scope 1 GHG emissions | tCO₂e |
| Scope 2 GHG emissions (LB & MB) | tCO₂e |
| Scope 3 GHG emissions | tCO₂e |
| GHG emissions intensity | tCO₂e / $M revenue |
| % renewable energy | % |
| Internal carbon price | $/tCO₂e |
| Climate-related capex | $M |
| % revenue from low-carbon products | % |
| Physical risk financial exposure | $M |

| TCFD Recommendation | Report Section | Page |
|---|---|---|
| Governance (a) | Corporate Governance Report | XX |
| Governance (b) | Sustainability Report — Governance | XX |
| Strategy (a) | Climate Risk Section | XX |
| ... | ... | ... |
